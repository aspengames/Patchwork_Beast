### About The Game

Patchwork Beast is a top-down roleplaying game centered around curing a forest of
a mysterious affliction. A seemingly sentient beast made of haphazardly welded
parts has awakened and is rotting the forest from the inside out with metallic
Corrosion. You are a visiting traveler whose magic staff may be the key to stopping
this evil before it turns the land barren.
